<div>
    Specify the number of executors that this job needs to occupy.
    Setting this to a bigger value is useful if your job is known to consume multiple threads,
    so that the scheduling decision is done accordingly &mdash; for example, say your job
    runs tests with 4 threads simultaneously. Specifying 4 makes Hudson schedule your builds
    to only run on a slave with 4 or more executors, and if your build is then run
    on a slave with 5 executors, the slave will have just one more available executor, making
    it that much less likely for Hudson to schedule additional builds on the same node.

    <p>
    Specifying 0 here is the same as specifying 1.
