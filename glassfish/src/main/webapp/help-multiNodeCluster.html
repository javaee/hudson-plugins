<P>For multi-node cluster, GlassFish DAS and the first GlassFish Instance is deployed on current computer (build executor).</P> 

<P>Rest of the Instances are deployed on other Hudson nodes - called GlassFish plugin subslaves. </P>


<P><b>Logic:</b></P>

<UL>
	<LI><P>Number Of Instance:   <b>i</b></P>
	<LI><P>Number Of Nodes:   <b>n</b></P>
</UL>


<OL>
	<LI><P> If  n = 1  :  Create Single Node Cluster - Start <b>i</b> instances on 1 Node. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>If  n &gt;= i :  Create Multi Node Cluster, Single Instance Per Nodes 
	</P>
	<LI><P> If  1 &lt; n &lt; i : Start  <b>i / n </b> instances on each node, in a round robin fashion.</P>
</OL>
<P>For Example, if the user Selects:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Number Of Instance:  7</P>
	<LI><P>Number Of Nodes:  3</P>
</UL>
<P>    Then instance Names will be:  in1, in2, in3, in4, in5, in6, in7  </P>
<P>    Node1 will run: DAS, in1, in4, in7</P>
<P>    Node2 will run: in2, in5</P>
<P>    Node3 will run: in3, in6</P>
